# BeDIPS-Installation-Tool
BeDIPS Installation Tool: To make Lbeacons for each area ready for installation, the installer fixes the barcode and loads the coordinates and location description of each Lbeacon on the beacon using the user interface and tools provided by the BeDIS server. The installation is carried out with the help of an installation tool that has a barcode scanner, a servomotor controlled laser pointer and network connection to BeDIS server.
